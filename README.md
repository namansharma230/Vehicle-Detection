# Vehicle-Detection
The burgeoning challenges of urbanization, coupled with the relentless surge in technological advancements, have significantly transformed the landscape of transportation. As cities expand and populations swell, the roadways become arteries of life, pulsating with an ever-increasing flow of vehicles. In the intricate tapestry of urban mobility, the effective management of vehicular traffic emerges as a paramount concern. Traditional methods of monitoring and controlling traffic, although functional, grapple with the complexities of modern urban scenarios characterized by multifaceted challenges, dynamic conditions, and diverse vehicle types. In response to this, there arises an imperative need for intelligent solutions that can not only detect and count vehicles with unprecedented accuracy but can also adapt seamlessly to the evolving intricacies of urban landscapes.
